\paragraph{\#1. -- Exercise 5.2} *Suppose that the means and standard deviations of $Y$ and $X$ are the same: $\bar{Y} = \bar{X}$ and $S_{Y} = S_{X}$. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)] Show that under these circumstances,
  \[
    B_{Y|X} = B_{X|Y} = r_{XY}
  \]
  where $B_{Y|X}$ is the least-squares slope for the simple regression of $Y$
  on $X$; $B_{X|Y}$ is the least-squares slope for the simple regression of
  $X$ on $Y$; and $r_{XY}$ is the correlation between the two variables. Show
  that the intercepts are also the same, $A_{Y|X} = A_{X|Y}$. 
  
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  For the simple regression of $Y$ on $B$, $\hat{Y_i} = A + B X_i$, taking
  \[
    B = \dfrac{\sum_{i} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}
          {\sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
      \equiv \dfrac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2}, \text{ and }
    A = \bar{Y} - B \bar{X}
  \]
  where $S_X^2$ is the sample variance of $X$, gives us the coefficients that
  minimize the least squares equation. Hence, if $S_X = S_Y$, then using the
  symmetry of $S_{XY}$ (i.e. $S_{XY}=S_{YX}$),
  \[
    B_{Y|X} = \dfrac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2} = \dfrac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}S_{Y}}
            = \dfrac{S_{YX}}{S_{Y}S_{X}} = B_{X|Y}
  \]
  And since we define $r_{XY}$ to be $S_{XY}/S_{X}S_{Y}$, it follows that
  \[
    B_{Y|X} = B_{X|Y} = r_{XY}
  \]
  Thus, if $S_X = S_Y$ \textit{and} $\bar{Y} = \bar{X}$, then
  \[
    A_{Y|X} = \bar{Y} - B_{Y|X} \bar{X} = \bar{X} - B_{X|Y} \bar{Y} = A_{X|Y}
  \]
  %%-------------------------------
  
  \item[(b)] Why, if $A_{Y|X} = A_{X|Y}$ and $B_{Y|X} = B_{X|Y}$, is the
  least-squares line for the regression of $Y$ on $X$ different from the line
  from the regression of $X$ on $Y$ (as long as $r^2 < 1$)?
  
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  Denote the line for the regression of $Y$ on $X$ is by $f(x) = A_{Y|X} +
  B_{Y|X} x$. If we try inverting this line, and solving for $x$ as a function
  of $f(x)$, we get 
  \[
    h(f(x)) = (f(x) - A_{Y|X})/B_{Y|X} = B_{Y|X}^{-1}f(x) - \frac{A_{Y|X}}{B_{Y|X}}
  \]
  If we let $g(y) = A_{X|Y} + B_{X|Y} y$ denote the line for the regression of
  $X$ on $Y$, then for $h(y) = g(y)$, we would need
  \[
    B_{Y|X}^{-1} = B_{X|Y}, \text{ and } A_{X|Y} = - \frac{A_{Y|X}}{B_{Y|X}}
  \]
  Since we're still assuming equal means and variances, the first condition
  is equivalent to asking for $B_{X|Y}^2 = 1$, or $r^2 = 1$. However, we're
  assuming that $r^2 < 1$, so this situation cannot be. Thus, we cannot have
  equal regression lines.
  %%-------------------------------
  
  \item[(c)] "Regression toward the mean" (the original sense of the term
  "regression"): Imagine that $X$ is father's height and $Y$ is son's height
  for a sample of father-son pairs. Suppose that $S_{Y} = S_{X}$, that
  $\bar{Y} = \bar{X}$, and that the regression of sons' heights on fathers' 
  heights is linear. Finally, suppose that $0 < r_{XY} < 1$ (i.e., fathers'
  and sons' heights are positively correlated, but not perfectly so).
  Show that the expected height of a son whose father is shorter than average
  is also less than average, but to a smaller extent; likewise, the expected
  height of a son whose father is taller than average is also greater than
  average, but to a smaller extent. Does this result imply a contradiction
  -- that the standard deviation of a son's height is infact less that that
  of father's height?
  
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  Recall that when we perform regression, we're actually make a statement about
  the conditional mean of one variable given another. Precisely, $\hat{Y}$ is
  supposed to estimate $E(Y | X)$. So, if we translate the phrase, ``the
  expected height of a son whose father is shorter than average is also less
  than average, but to a smaller extent'' into symbols, it will read:
  \[
    0 < \bar{Y} - E(Y_i | X_i < \bar{X}) < \bar{X} - X_i
  \]
  Hence, if we can prove $0 < \bar{Y} - \hat{Y}_i < \bar{X} - X_i$, when $X_i$
  is less than average, we're done.
  Using the results from part (a), and the assumption that $r_{XY} \in (0,1)$,
  \begin{align*}
    \bar{Y} - \hat{Y}_i &= \bar{Y} - (A + B X_i) \\
      &= \bar{Y} - \parenths{\bar{Y} + r_{XY}(X_i - \bar{X})} \\
      &= r_{XY}(\bar{X} - X_i) \\
      &< \bar{X} - X_i
    \intertext{and using $r > 0$:}
    \bar{Y} - \hat{Y}_i &= r_{XY}(\bar{X} - X_i) > 0
  \end{align*}
  Hence,
  \[
    0 < \bar{Y} - \hat{Y}_i < X_i - \bar{X}
  \]
  Similarly, if $X_i - \bar{X} > 0$, 
  \begin{align*}
    \hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y} &=  \parenths{\bar{Y} + r_{XY}(X_i - \bar{X}) } 
                        - \bar{Y} \\
      &= r_{XY}(X_i - \bar{X}) \\
      &< (X_i - \bar{X})
    \intertext{and}
    \hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y} &= r_{XY}(X_i - \bar{X}) > 0
  \end{align*}
  
  Now, while this results shows that for all $i$, $(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2 <
  (X_i - \bar{X})^2$, this does \textit{not} imply that $(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 < 
  (X_i - \bar{X})^2$. The latter expression involves observed values, while
  the former expression involves \textit{expected values}. Hence, while we may
  say that the $\text{Reg}SS$ is less than the $(n-1) S_{X}^2$, we do not have
  the license to say that $S_{Y}^{2} < S_{X}^2$. 
  %%-------------------------------

  \item[(d)] What is the expected height for a father whose son is shorter
  than average? Of a father whose son is taller than average?
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution If we reverse the regression, and now regression fathers' height
  on sons' height, because we're assuming $S_X = S_Y$ and $\bar{X} = \bar{Y}$,
  we arrive at the same conclusion as in part (c): the expected height of a 
  father whose son is shorter (taller) than average is shorter (taller) than
  average, but to a smaller extent. 
  
  %%-------------------------------
  \item[(e)] Regression effects in research design: Imagine that educational
  researchers wish to assess the efficacy of a new program to improve the
  reading performance of children. To test the program, they recruit a group
  of children who are reading substantially below grade level; after a year
  in the program, the researchers observe that the children, on average, have
  improved their reading performance. Why is this a weak research design?
  How could it be improved?
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  As we saw in part (c), children of short men tend to get raised up to the
  mean. Hence, if we consider $X_i$ the reading performance of a child at the
  start of the program of $Y_i$ their performance a year later, then by what
  we just proved, we should expect $Y_i$ to be closer to the mean than $X_i$. 
  In particular, we expect $Y_i$ to be higher, on average, since the children
  were chosen such that $X_i < \bar{X}$. 
  
  One way to improve this design is to sample from both the strong and weak
  readers, and then review their performances a year later. If both groups
  exhibit a significant difference, then we may be able to assess the efficacy
  of the program.

\paragraph{\#3. -- Exercise 5.3.} *Show that $A' = \bar{Y}$ minimizes the sum of squares
\[
  S(A') = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - A')^2
\]

%%-------------------------------
\Solution
There are a few ways to do this, but the most straightfoward is with calculus.

Consider $S(A')$ like any other real-valued function of one variable. We'll
solve for where $S'(A') = 0$, and check to see if that is a (global) minimum.
If it is, we've found our minimizer.

\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{dA'} S(A') &= \frac{d}{dA'} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - A')^2 \\
                      &= -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - A') \\
                      &= -2n \, \bar{Y} + 2n A'
\end{align*}
Hence, $d S(x)/ dx \bigr|_{x=A'} = 0$ precisely when $A' = \bar{Y}$.

Now, to see that this is a minimum, notice that $S''(A') = 2n > 0$. Hence, the
second derivative is positive at the critical value, implying that 
$A' = \bar{Y}$ is a global minimum. 
%%-------------------------------

\paragraph{\#4.} Show the statement given in the book (p. 84) that
\[
  \sum_{i}(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y}) = 0
\]
proving that $TSS = RSS + \text{Reg}SS$.

%%-------------------------------
\Solution
Using the least-squares coefficients defined in problem \#1,
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y}) &=
    \sum_i \parenths{Y_i - \bar{Y} - \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2}(X_i - \bar{X})}
      \parenths{\frac{S_{XY}}{S_X^2}(X_i - \bar{X})} \\
    &= \sum_i \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2} (Y_i - \bar{Y})(X_i - \bar{X})
      - \parenths{\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2}}^2 (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \\
    &= \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2} \sum_i (Y_i - \bar{Y})(X_i - \bar{X})
        - \parenths{\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2}}^2 \sum_i (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \\
    &= \frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2} S_{XY}
        - \parenths{\frac{S_{XY}}{S_{X}^2}}^2 S_{X}^2 \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}
%%-------------------------------

\paragraph{\#5.} Suppose $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ are i.i.d. random variables with
mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Let 
$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2$, where 
$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} y_i$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(a)] Show that $\sum_{i}(y_i - \bar{y})^2$ can be expressed as 
  $ \y^{T} (\I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n \one_n^{T}) \y $ where $\I_n$ is the 
  identity matrix of order $n$, and $\one_n$ is a vector of length $n$ 
  consisting of all ones.
  
  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  Let's start with the vector algebra:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T} \y &= \frac{1}{n} \one_{n} \ip{\one_n, \y} \\
                                        &= \frac{1}{n} \one_{n} \sum_{i} y_i \\
                                        &= \one_{n} \bar{y}
    \intertext{Hence,}
    (\I_n - \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}) \y &= \y - \one_{n} \bar{y} \\
                        &= (y_1 - \bar{y}, y_2 - \bar{y}, \ldots, y_n - \bar{y})
    \intertext{and thus}
    \y^{T} (\I_n - \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}) \y
                        &= \ip{\y, \y - \one_n \bar{y}} \\
                        &= \sum_i y_i(y_i - \bar{y})
  \end{align*}
  Now, we're not quite done. Recall that
  \[
    \sum_i \bar{y}(y_i - \bar{y}) = \sum_{i} \bar{y} y_i - n \bar{y}^2 =
    n \bar{y}^2 - n \bar{y}^2 = 0
  \]
  Hence, 
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_i y_i(y_i - \bar{y}) &= \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y} + \bar{y})(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
        &= \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2 + \sum_{i} \bar{y}(y_i - \bar{y}) \\
        &= \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2
  \end{align*}
  Which demonstrates that $\sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2 = \y^{T} (\I_n - \frac{1}{n}
  \one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}) \y $. 
  %%-------------------------------
  \item[(b)] Use the matrix form of $s^2$ to show that $E(s^2) = \sigma^2$
  (i.e. do not manipulate the sum directly, but use only the matrix definition).

  %%-------------------------------
  \Solution
  Note that the result of part (a) indicates that $s^2$ can be written as a
  quadratic form. Hence, we can use the identity
  \[
    E(\X^{T} A \X) = E(\X)^{T} A E(\X) + \tr(A \Sigma)
  \]
  where $A$ is some non-random matrix, and $\Sigma$ is $\X$'s covariance
  matrix.\footnote{See the ``Expected value, covariance, and cross-covariance''
  section of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_vector}{
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random\_vector} for a nice proof of this fact.}
  
  In our case, we'll take $\y$ to play the role of $\X$, $\mu \one_n$ to play
  the role of $E(\y)$, and $\sigma^2 \I_n$ to play the role of the covariance
  matrix. Hence, 
  \begin{align*}
    E\parenths{(n-1) s^2} &= E\parenths{\sum_i (y_i- \bar{y})^2 } \\
      &= E\parenths{\y^{T}\parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}} \y} \\
      &= E(\y)^{T} \parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}} E(\y)
      + \tr\parenths{\parenths{\I_n - 
          \frac{1}{n}\one_{n} \one_{n}^{T}} \sigma^2 \I_n} \\
      &= \mu^2 \one_{n}^{T} \parenths{ \I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n \one_n^T }
        \one_{n} + \sigma^2 \tr\parenths{ \parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n^T
          \one_{n}} \I_n }
  \end{align*}
  To proceed, we'll need to evaluate each term in the sum above:
  \begin{align*}
    \one_{n}^{T} \parenths{ \I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n \one_n^T } \one_{n}
      &= \one_{n}^{T} \parenths{\one_{n} - \frac{1}{n} \one_n \one_n^T \one_{n}} \\
      &= \parenths{\one_{n}^{T} \one_{n} - 
          \frac{1}{n} \one_{n}^{T} \one_n \one_n^T \one_{n}} \\
      &= \ip{\one_{n}, \one_{n}} - \frac{1}{n} \ip{\one_n, \one_n}^2 \\
      &= n - \frac{n^2}{n} \\
      &= 0
    \intertext{and using the fact that $\frac{1}{n} \one_n^T \one_n$ is the
    matrix whose entries are all $1/n$:}
    \tr\parenths{ \parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n^T \one_{n}} \I_n }
      &= \tr\parenths{ \parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n^T \one_{n}} } \\
      &= \tr\begin{pmatrix} 1-\frac{1}{n} & -\frac{1}{n} & \cdots \\
                             -\frac{1}{n} &1-\frac{1}{n} & \cdots \\
                             \vdots       &              &  \ddots 
            \end{pmatrix} \\
      &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1- \frac{1}{n} \\
      &= n-1
  \end{align*}
  Thus,
  \[
    E\parenths{(n-1)s^2} 
      = \mu^2 \one_{n}^{T} \parenths{ \I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n \one_n^T } 
        \one_{n} + \sigma^2 \tr\parenths{ \parenths{\I_n - \frac{1}{n} \one_n^T
        \one_{n}} \I_n }
      = \mu^2 \cdot 0 + \sigma^2 (n-1)
  \]
  which demonstrates that $E(s^2) = \sigma^2$.

  \ref{fig:prob6aPairsPlot}, \ref{fig:prob6aCoplot}, and \ref{fig:prob6aScatterplot}
  for the histograms, boxplots, pairs plot, coplots, and scatterplots (respectively). 
  
  For the histograms, note that all the continuous variables, with the exception
  of \texttt{acceleration} seemed to exhibit right-skewed distributions.
  Whereas, \texttt{acceleration}'s distribution is bell-shaped (either student's
  $t$, or normally distributed). The majority of vehicles in this dataset have 4
  cylinders, which is nearly double what the second most amount of cars has
  (103 cars with 8 cylinders). Also, over 1/2 of the cars in this set came from
  wherever $\texttt{origin} = 1$. 
  
  Interestingly, the boxplot of \texttt{mpg} indicates its values are not as
  skewed as one may have previously believed from the density plot, alone.
  However, \texttt{displacement}, \texttt{horsepower} and \texttt{weight} all
  have medians which sit slightly south of where one would expect for 
  ``un-skewed'' distributions.
  
  I chose to investigate the relationship between \texttt{mpg},
  \texttt{displacement} (i.e. engine size) and \texttt{horsepower} because the
  latter two variables have a large correlation (\Sexpr{cor(cars_dt$horsepower,
  cars_dt$displacement)}), while also seeming to trend quite tightly with
  \texttt{mpg} (correlation of \Sexpr{cor(cars_dt$mpg, cars_dt$displacement)}
  between \texttt{mpg} and \texttt{displacement} and of \Sexpr{cor(cars_dt$mpg,
  cars_dt$horsepower)} between \texttt{mpg} and \texttt{horsepower}). However,
  as the plots indicate, conditioning on either one does not induce any sort of
  independence between \texttt{mpg} and the other. On the other hand, there does
  seem to be only a slight amount of dependence between \texttt{mpg} and
  \texttt{acceleration} once you condition on \texttt{horsepower}. Also, if you
  compare how the various cars' mpg vary, pound-for-pound, as a function of
  origin, it's interesting to see that country 2 seems to do better with heavier
  cars.
  
  Finally, to satisfy the high-school physicist in all of us, I decided to
  checkout the relationship between acceleration and displacement. Initially, I
  figured that since displacement is a rough measure of engine size, the larger
  the value, the better acceleration a car would have. This turns out to be wildly
  false, and the general trend is quite the opposite: smaller enginers seem to
  have better acceleration.
